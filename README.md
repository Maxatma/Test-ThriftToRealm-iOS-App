# Test-ThriftToRealm-iOS-App


Yes, so its just example iOS app that uses test .thrift [file](https://github.com/Maxatma/TPerfectServer-example/blob/master/test.thrift) and all generated data from [ThriftToRealm](https://github.com/Maxatma/ThriftToRealm-MacOS-App) convertion flow.

Download and install pods to make it work.
You also could try to run test [server](https://github.com/Maxatma/TPerfectServer-example) if u want to have network calls working.
